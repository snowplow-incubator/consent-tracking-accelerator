### Consent Tracking for Marketing accelerator
#### Introduction:

This accelerator will guide you to collect user interactions and preferences from your Consent Management Platform (CMP) using the enhanced consent plugin from Snowplow.

User consent for data collection is vital when referring to product, personalisation, marketing and ML-driven actions. CMPs provide a limited amount of data on user preferences and with Snowplow's enhanced consent plugin this can become a rich source of information to understand the consent aspect regarding your business.

Using Snowplow to collect consent preference data, you can enrich your data model with user level, granular and context-rich selection data. Having user consent data available in your data storage allows enriching your segments or ML models with this information and take action based on your customer preferences.


Here you will learn how to:

- Set-up Snowplow Consent Tracking on your CMP (_example using Cookiebot_)
- Model your data using the Snowplow-Consent model
- Create a consent health check dashboard from your data in Streamlit

#### Who is this guide for?

- Data practitioners who would like to get familiar with the Snowplow enhanced-consent-plugin.
- Data practitioners who want to learn how to use the snowplow-consent dbt package and set-up tracking using their companies website or single page application, to gain insight from their customersâ€™ behavioural data as quickly as possible.

#### What you will learn

In approximately 5 working hours you can achieve the following:

- **Track -** Set-up and deploy tracking to your website or single page application to allow consent tracking
- **Enrich -** Add extra properties and values to your collected data
- **Model -** Enable and run the consent module within the snowplow-web data model
- **Visualise -** Visualise the modeled data with Streamlit
